## Short about the difficulties on the way to implementation

The first difficulties were with understanding the project architecture, 
connections, and responsibilities of entities. But over time everything became clear. 
The next difficult step was Liquibase, namely the correctness of the changesets writing, 
its syntax, but again, a little research and time paid off. 
In the final stage of the project, there were difficulties with writing tests, 
because I met SpringBoot testing for the first time and testing different layers 
of the program required different approaches. But this was also overcome ðŸ¤Ÿ
